  <p>
    Welcome! I am a researcher in mathematical logic, computational analysis, topology & functional analysis, complexity theory, functional analysis and the philosophy of perception.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my career so far, I have gained extensive experience in the field of partial differential equations, 
    as well as calculus of variations, functional analysis, spectral theory and mathematical logic. In my computer science studies
    I also had deep contact to decidability problems, like the SAT problem and descriptive set theory.
