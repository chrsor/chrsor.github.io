  We study the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) of Koopman operator spectral computation in the information-based framework of towers of algorithms.
  Given a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X},d)$ with a finite Borel measure $\omega$ on $\mathcal{X}$ and a continuous
  nonsingular map $F:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$, our focus is the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}_F$ acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $p\in\{1,\infty\}$ for the computational problem
  \[
   \Xi_{\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}}(F)
   :=\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}\!\bigl(\mathcal{K}_F\bigr),
  \]
  with input access given by point evaluations of $F\mapsto F(x)$ (and
  fixed quadrature access to $\omega$).

  We clarify how the $L^1$ case can be brought into the same oracle model as the reflexive
  regime $1<p<\infty$ by proving a uniform finite-dimensional quadrature compatibility, while highlighting the fundamentally different role played by non-separability at $p=\infty$.

  Beyond Koopman operators, we also construct a prototype family of decision problems
  $(\Xi_m)_{m\in\mathbb N}$ realizing prescribed finite tower heights, providing a reusable
  reduction source for future SCI lower bounds.
  Finally, we place these results deeper in the broader computational landscape of Type-2/Weihrauch theory.
