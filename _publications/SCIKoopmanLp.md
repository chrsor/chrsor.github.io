  We study the computation of the approximate point spectrum and the approximate point
  $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of bounded Koopman operators acting on
  $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $1 < p < \infty$ and a compact metric space
  $(\mathcal{X}, d_{\mathcal{X}})$ with finite Borel measure $\omega$. Building on finite sections in a computable unconditional Schauder basis of $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$, we design residual tests that use only finitely many evaluations of the underlying map and produce compact sets on a planar grid, that converge in the Hausdorff metric to the target spectral sets, without spectral pollution. From these constructions we obtain a complete classification, in the sense of the Solvability Complexity Index, of how many limiting procedures are inherently necessary.
